jrc
===

this is an experiment to make a thing that sorta acts like Rails' or Django's
command-line utilities. it's cool because it means your metaprogram is a
command-line utility you can just run wherever, and you can add all kinds of
contextual functionality to it.

setup
-----

 - add the `jrc/bin` directory to your PATH.
 - `jrc help`

**Q: why?**

A: for fun. maybe someone could build something neat out of this. or maybe it's
too overcomplicated to be useful. either way, it was fun to make.
